## 1 Introduction

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can obtain the distribution of various physical quantities of a fluid, such as density, pressure and velocity, by solving the Navier-Stokes equations (N-S equations), and is widely used in fields such as MEMS, civil engineering and aerospace. However, in some complex application scenarios, such as wing optimization and fluid-structure interaction, the problem needs to be modeled using tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of meshes (as shown in the figure below, which illustrates a fully integrated structured mesh model of the internal and external flow of an F-18 fighter jet), resulting in a very large computational effort for CFD. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a method that is more efficient than traditional CFD methods and can maintain computational accuracy. The authors of this paper suggest that a data-driven CFD computational model can be built using deep learning methods by training a small amount of data from traditional CFD simulations to solve the above problem.

### 1.2 Method

The authors propose a convolutional neural networks-based CFD computational model, called DeepCFD, which can simultaneously compute the flow field of a fluid flowing over an arbitrary obstacle. The method has the following features:

1. DeepCFD is essentially a CNN-based model that can be used to rapidly compute two-dimensional non-uniform steady-state laminar flow, which can achieve at least three orders of magnitude speedups compared to traditional CFD methods while maintaining computational accuracy.

2. DeepCFD can calculate fluid velocities in both x- and y-directions, as well as fluid pressures.

3. The data for training the model were calculated by OpenFOAM (an open source CFD calculation software).

The following two figures show the calculation schematic and the network structure of the method, respectively. The basic structure of the DeepCFD network used in this paper is a U-net type network with three inputs and three outputs. The inputs of the model are the signed distance function (SDF) of the obstacle in the computational domain, the SDF of the computational domain boundary and the label of the flow region; the outputs are the x-direction velocity, y-direction velocity and fluid pressure of the fluid. The basic principle of the model is to use the convolution layer in the encoder part to downsample the three inputs into intermediate quantities, and then use the same structure of the decoder in the deconvolution layer to upsample the intermediate quantities into three fluid physical quantities output.

**step4：train**

**Single GPU**

```python
python train.py
```

**Multi GPU**

Take four GPUs as an example.

```python
python -m paddle.distributed.launch --gpus=0,1,2,3 train.py
```

The results are saved in the result file (note: the result folder already contains a complete training process, which can be emptied before training). Multi GPU training generates an additional . /log/ folder to store the training logs.

```python
.
├── log
│   ├── workerlog.0
│   ├── workerlog.1
│   ├── workerlog.2
│   └── workerlog.3
└── train.py
```

Some of the training logs are shown below.

```python

	Validation Uy MSE = 19.184117617849576
	Validation p MSE = 170.37347887976694
```

**step5：evaluation**

```python
python eval.py
```

The output is:

```python
Total MSE is 1.895322561264038, Ux MSE is 0.6951090097427368, Uy MSE is 0.21001490950584412, p MSE is 0.9901986718177795
```

**step6：prediction**

Considering the need to show the flow field image comparison results, a separate predict.ipynb was written for model validation, which needs to be run in the Jupyter notebook environment.

```python
jupyter notebook predict.ipynb
```

The flow field prediction results for a particular obstacle are shown below.
